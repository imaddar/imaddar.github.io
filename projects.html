          <div class="list-heading">Contractor-OS</div>
          <p>
            Construction management hub with a LangChain-powered copilot that
            streamlines general contractor's data, a core issue in their complex workflows.
            Contractors can use agents to talk directly with their uploaded documents,
            generating tasks and scheduling them to simplify the busy work.

              For my capstone project, my team and I are building a tool to accelerate 
              engineering drawings with LLMs. Based on our interviews, mechanical
              engineers can spend up to nearly half their time annotating drawings,
              with most of it spent on tedious tasks such as labeling measurements.
              We are both speeding up the annotation process and providing a quality
              assurance layer, making sure engineers aren't making any expensive mistakes.

            We extended a POMDP planner with deep learning policies so an actor can move through crowded environments 
            with lower performance overhead compared to existing solutions. By leveraging trained policy
            and value networks, we applied the work of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00249">BetaZero</a> paper
            to our crowded environment. This project was an extension of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10028">the work</a>
            done by our colleagues Gupta et al.

              For a hackathon we built a chrome extension to help verify claims found on the internet.
              By highlighting a chunk of text, we clean the text, optimize it for search query, and
              scrape websites to compare with top results. By doing the heavy lifting beforehand, we
              can leverage much smaller, local models to speed up inference and reduce costs while 
              maintaining exceptional performance.

          <p>
              Wrote a python script to ingest clips from soccer matches to track players.
              By finetuning a YOLOv8 model, it can accurately detect 
              players, referees, and balls. Futhermore, by using k-means clustering
              to determine player teams, useful statistics can also be extracted
              like percentage of possesion, player speeds, and individual player numbers.
